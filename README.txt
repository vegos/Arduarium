Arduarium
=========

Aquarium Controller (work in progress)
Created for the Aquarium of my friend, GeGeor :)

Hardware:
- ATmega328
  Capacitors, resistors, push switch, LED, 7805 Voltage Regulator etc, as it created on a general-purpose PCB.
- LCD display (16x2) & I2C Driver (for using 2 wires)
- Two (2) Relay Module for powering on/off the water pump and the fan.
  In the future, it will be expanded with more functions.
- 4x4 Matrix Keyboard. For easier access to the menu system/settings.
- Water Sensor (actually, a water-triggered button) for metering the water level.
- LM35 Temperature Sensor (and waterproffing it using silicone).

(Temperature sensor is not installed --  that's the reasing for the weird results)

Wiring:
- I guess you can find out the wiring following the PIN assignments on the code.

To be continued...
